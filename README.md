#Moonstar coding test for fullstack developer

## Introduction

One of the junior team members has been asked by the product owner to build a simple POC of the newsfeed similar to Facebook/ LinkedIn one.

We wanter to have a separte backend and frontend solutions.

He started working on it, but got sick and now is unavailable.

Product Owner asked you if you can complete the work.

## Backend

We want to have basic Get, GetById, Post, Put, Patch and Delete implemented.

Users should be able to create a photos using text only, photo only or text and photo. Posts is the only entity that api should support, there are no other enitites required.

We need to follow all rest api guidelines as best as we can. The only expection is that we do not need to return descriptive messages.

## Frontend

We need to create a modern newsfeed that will show the posts. It's up to you to design best user experience. We just want something that feels modern.

When user clicks on post, post should appear in the full screen.

User should also have the ability to add, edit and delete the post.

98% of our user base uses mobile devices.

You can choose the technology that you like but this technology should not use SSR.

## Bonus points

### Backend

- Write tests
- Implement better architecture, decouple data access layer from api layer
- Make sure we follow best REST guidelines
- Use most efficent LINQ methods, including in presupplied endpoints
- Docerize the solution + database
- Deploy the solution to the cloud, manually or with CI/ CD pipeline
- Add OpenApi and/ or Swagger
- Wrtie a nice Readme file

### Frontend

- Write tests
- Implement modern pagination, that would be good for newsfeed
- Implement second layout for desktop
- Use scss to describe classes
- Use Typescript
- Use pure Javascript/ Typescript with no runtime dependencies
- If you are using any framework minize dependencies
- Write a nice Readme file

Any other ideas of your choice.
